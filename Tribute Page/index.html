            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>
                Born in London on December 10, 1815, Lovelace was the only legitimate daughter of the famous poet Lord Byron and his wife Baroness Byron. The Baroness fostered an interest in mathematics and logic in her daughter. One of Ada's mentors was <u>Augustus De Morgan</u>,
                the first professor of mathematics at the University of London — which was the first university in England to allow women to graduate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ada was just a teenager when, at dinner with her mother, she met <u>Charles Babbage</u>, a middle-aged scientist who presented his ideas with great conviction and confidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Charles was building an error-proof calculating machine, and Ada was interested in it from the beginning. Then, right away, Charles realized that this girl knew a lot more about math than all the men in the room.
            </p>

            <div class="container" id="img-div">
                <img class="imgBabbage" src="assets/charles-babbage.png" alt="Charles Babbage" />
                <div class="overlay">Charles Babbage</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Her work with Charles Babbage Lovelace became friends and worked with the scientist. She was honored to participate in his project on the Analytical Engine - evolution of the Differential Engine (which was created to perform and print mathematical calculations).
                The Analytical Engine was the first machine in history that could be programmed to execute commands of any kind, but the young scientist realized that the machine was capable of doing much more than its creator imagined. Charles was impressed
                and asked Ada to look over her notes about the machine, as a sort of proofreader. Ada took the request so seriously that not only did she review the material he had created, she wrote a stack of notes about many other things that this
                machine could still do, but that Charles still hadn't figured out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Between 1842 and 1843, she translated an Italian article on the engine and supplemented the study with a set of her own observations. These notes contained an algorithm created to be processed by machines, being considered the first computer program ever
                created. In this way, what Ada noticed is that if he exchanged the numbers she wanted to calculate with other elements (such as letters, symbols, codes) he could program and reprogram the machine to do whatever he wanted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ada also developed a vision of the ability of computers to do much more than just calculations, at a time when all mathematicians were focused on this type of action. That is, Ada Lovelace was way ahead of her time when she conceived the idea of ​​what
                an algorithm could do.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ada's notes were not fully understood until nearly 100 years after her death, and the genius poetic scientist lived and died without even imagining that she would change the history of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lovelace was the first person programmer of all time, not just the first woman to write code. The relevance of her creation is such that, since 2009, every Monday and Tuesday of the month of October, “Ada Lovelace Day” is celebrated around the world -
                date created by Suw Charman-Anderson to celebrate and spread around the world the achievements of women in science, inspiring others to pursue careers in this field.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h2>The Lovelace Legacy</h2>
            <p>
                The Countess died of uterine cancer at age 36, but her legacy is more alive than ever. Our society would not be full of computers and smartphones, for example, if it hadn't been so brilliant in the development of the first algorithm in history, as it
                opened doors for other scientists to improve these concepts and develop new technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lovelace's notes on Babbage's analytical machine were republished in 1953, nearly a hundred years after Babbage's death. This machine was recognized as the first computer model ever built, and the math notes were marked as the first description of a computer
                and software.
            </p>
            <p>
                While she invested in her studies and career, Lovelace also used to drink and gamble - unusual habits for women at the time. Therefore, Ada, in a way, was a pioneer of the feminist movement, even without having this pretension.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, she was not recognized during her lifetime. Her recognition as a pioneer in computing only came after Alan Turing referenced her work. Turing, known as “the father of modern computing”, was a British mathematician and computer scientist responsible
                for formalizing the concept of algorithm by creating the Turing Machine, which opened the door to the invention of the computers we use today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Augusta Ada Lovelace is known as the first computer programmer, and, since 2009, she has been recognized annually on October 15th to highlight the often overlooked contributions of women to math and science. The main event is being held today at Imperial
                College London, with the début of an anthology of essays, “A Passion for Science: Stories of Discovery and Invention.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I started to think that one of the biggest parts of the problem was that women in tech are often invisible,” Suw Charman-Anderson, the founder of Ada Lovelace Day, told me. After reading a study in 2006 by the psychologist Penelope Lockwood, who researched
                the dearth of female role models in the sciences, Charman-Anderson thought that a fête for Lovelace could raise awareness of her noteworthy successors.
            </p>
            <p>
                This year, dozens of celebrations will be thrown around the world, including an “Ada Lovelace Edit-a-thon” at Brown University, where volunteers will ramp up Wikipedia entries for female scientists.
            </p>
            <p class="cite">
                “Lovelace is an unusual example of a woman for her time because she was not only allowed to learn mathematics but encouraged to learn mathematics,” - Valerie Aurora, the executive director of the Ada Initiative, a nonprofit organization that arranges
                conferences and training programs to elevate women working in math and science - “She shows what women can do when given a chance.”
